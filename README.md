# ArthaFlow
ArthaFlow is a SIP simulation tool that projects long-term wealth using assumed returns, asset allocation, inflation adjustment, and tax estimation. It supports conservative to aggressive portfolios with clear visualizations. This is a deterministic, educational simulation—not financial advice or a guarantee of returns.
